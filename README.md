# SwiftForTensorFlow

Ongoing training project...

## Lessons learned so far:
- Setting up a notebook with Swift kernel on Google Colab
- Use Python in a Swift environment (PythonKit)
- Classification of Iris Flowers (ongoing)
  - Import data
  - Explore data
  - Create Model
  - ...

## Current Next Steps:
- investigate on valueWithGradient function
- continue Iris Flower Classification notebook

## Personal Findings:
- no typealiases needed for imported packages due to syntax change (compared to python)
- google colab makes it harder to look deep into the tf framework, might want to install it locally for next session to use it in Xcode, or use Google Chrome?
- at least in the 'Classification of Iris Flowers' example there seems to be a lot more typing involed than with python
