# SwiftForTensorFlow

Ongoing training project...

## Lessons learned so far:
- Setting up a notebook with Swift kernel on Google Colab
- Use Python in a Swift environment (PythonKit)
- Classification of Iris Flowers (ongoing)
...

## Current Next Steps:
- getting more familiar with Swift protocols & extensions
- getting more familiar with Swift property wrappers
- continue Iris Flower Classification notebook

## Personal Findings:
- no typealiases needed for imported packages due to syntax change (compared to python)
- google colab makes it harder to look deep into the tf framework, might install it locally for next session to use it in Xcode
