# SwiftForTensorFlow

Trying out the Swift implementation of the tensorflow framework.

## Key Lessons learned:
- Setting up a notebook with Swift kernel on Google Colab
- Use Python in a Swift environment (PythonKit)
- Classification of Iris Flowers
  - Import data
  - Explore data
  - Create Model
  - Train Model
  - Evaluation and predicting

## Personal Findings:
- no typealiases needed for imported packages due to syntax change (compared to python)
- google colab makes it harder to look deep into the tf framework, might want to install it locally to use it in Xcode, or maybe use Google Chrome?
- at least in the 'Classification of Iris Flowers' example there seems to be a lot more typing involed than with python
- code uses a lot of swift specific syntax I wasn't aware of yet
- had many problems with the kernel crashing on me
- save from time to time back to github, when your browser crashes progress is lost
